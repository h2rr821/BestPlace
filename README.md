# BestPlace
Designed and implement an interactive web application that show nearby events based on the userâ€™s location and 
provide event recommendation based on user favorite records.

Content based recommender system
The recommended event will have the similar attributes: 
     1. same category
     2. same month
     3. within the radius of distance(+2 miles)

Unregister user can only see the nearby event. 
If they want to save the events to favorite, and get event recommendation, they have to be register user.
They can click the register button and register.

Register user can log in, then they can search with keyword and refine the radius of the search event.
They also can sort the event by date and by distance.
